# D3 Histogram 
An Apollo GraphQL based web application.

## About
This histogram web application was built using a relevantly-sized list of posts from a GraphQL API where I had to sort it according to the month that were created.

I used Apollo Client to fetch the data into my application and the D3.js library to display a nicely animated histogram where I had to display how many posts were created each month in the 2019 year.

I was not familiarized with how Apollo Client, GraphQL and D3.js library works, so, to start this project, I had to read documentation and follow tutorials in order to see how I can make them work together. It was a nice experience and i'm planning to use those technologies in my future projects.

## How it works
The app works very easy, after the list was received, an info will be displayed on the top showing you the status and the received posts number and a status text. You can see exactly how many posts were created each month by hovering over the month bar.
